# GeoTraceRoute

Built purely for a piece of coursework to extract data from a traceroute dump, then determine the location of each router as well as other information.

I am pooling my information from two main APIs:

WHO_IS_API = "http://free.ipwhois.io/json/"

EXTREME_LOOKUP_API = "https://extreme-ip-lookup.com/json/"

Its quite hacky because the actual code isn't going to be submitted, however it wouldn't be too hard for someone to re-purpose.
